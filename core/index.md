# Core

This documentation covers the **core** of the ModuBot project. The core is provided as the Python package `ModuBotCore` and forms the foundation for building modular and extensible bots with ModuBot.

- Use the default core out of the box or extend it with your own classes.
- Built-in configuration system with type checking.
- Flexible logger configuration.
- Easy module integration and management.

You can start ModuBotCore directly or customize its behavior by subclassing and overriding configuration options.
